    <p>
      Dear Dover, <br />
      <br />
      Thank you for your recent application to join us at
      <abbr title="University of Maryland, College Park">UMD</abbr>'s iSchool to
      study for your <em>undergraduate</em> in 2020. I will answer your
      questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Starting Dates
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
      however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
      semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <time datetime="2016-09-09">First semester: 9 September 2016</time>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time datetime="2017-01-15">Second semester: 15 January 2017</time>
      </li>
      <li><time datetime="2017-05-02">Third semester: 2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
      prefer. You can find more information about
      <a href="http://umd.ioLinks">important university dates</a> on our
      website.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Subjects of study
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the iSchool, we have a pretty <em>open-minded</em> research facility —
      as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information
      studies. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the
      kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas
      you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
      priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
        exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for
        representing musical scores.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
      including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
      other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Animals of the Extended Perambulation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study
      animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as follows,
      with definitions:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
      <dd>
        A large predator, very hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.
      </dd>
      <dt>The elk</dt>
      <dd>
        An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions
        of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also frequently
        visits the Banff centre for the arts.
      </dd>
      <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
      <dd>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe
        eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry
        is instead the call of the red-tail.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>

      Yours sincerely,<br />
